## v4.1.0

### New features

- Major overhaul to how and when certain parts of RES are executed - this MAY result in getting rid of the dreaded "flash of unstyled content", such as a white page before night mode kicks in, in some cases!
- Major additions to Dashboard - you can now see all of your user tags and subscribed threads there!
- Some efficiency improvements specific to the Firefox addon including: compiling with a new addon SDK version (biggest help), some adjustments to how storage is handled between tabs, and eliminating some code
- Added "fadespeed" option to user hover tooltip so that users can have it fade in/out faster (or just instantly appear)
- User tagger now stores a link to the link or comment you tagged a user from by default
- Added easy-access NSFW filter toggle to dropdown menu
- Now calling more HTTPS stuff to play nicer with addons like HTTPS Everywhere (note: compatibility is still not guaranteed)
- Added a way to dynamically grab known/popular bug reports and feature requests for when people try to submit to Enhancement or RESIssues
- Updated account switcher dropdown for easier access and more UI consistency
- Completely overhauled how uppers/downers are displayed - no more JSON request required, which means it's faster!
- Added "turbo selftext" option - which will make selftext expandos much faster after the first one you load on any given page
- Adjusted clickable area for selecting comments
- Added new subreddit tooltip - allows easy filtering, adding of shortcuts/dashboard widgets, etc
- New module: Comment hide persistor - keeps track of collapsed comments and re-collapses them when you return to a thread - thanks, umbrae!
- Added the ability to add custom macro buttons to comment preview toolbar
- Added "source" button to inbox
- Adding a class of .res to the BODY tag to help moderators better style their subreddits with RES in mind
- Added app=res to all calls to Reddit, so that the Reddit admins can more easily measure RES's impact
- Major overhaul of inline image viewer - improved code, support for a few more sites (deviantart, imgclean, picsarus, i.qkme), etc.
- Added a checkbox to more easily disable RES tips and tricks
- User tagger hover tip now works on /u/username links
- Added a few more URL patterns that will break out of the Reddit Toolbar since they don't play nice together
- Updated Never Ending Reddit with "friendlier" error messaging and easier reloading
- No longer auto-linking subreddits since Reddit now does it itself
- "Hard ignore" option in User Tagger now collapses sub comments as well
- Disabling "spam button" module by default due to misuse/abuse. If enabled, button now reads "rts" so as not to conflict with newly added "spam" button from Reddit itself
- Made a few code changes that should allow older versions of Firefox (via Greasemonkey) to still work. I cannot actively support this with a lot of time, but a cursory test shows you should be able to run RES with FF3.6+GM now.
- Added code to allow saving of comments even if they're from deleted users.
- Added user tagger / hover tip to flair page for moderators
- Added the ability for filteReddit and dashboard subreddits to be added even if they don't exist in Reddit's autocomplete feature
- Improved multireddit experience - now including +dashboard and +shortcut buttons for each reddit in the sidebar, etc
- Added "reddiquette" button to comment preview toolbar
- Updates to Reddit API calls to maintain current location protocol (should mean less problems browsing https with pay.reddit.com)
- Added a few more optional links to the subreddit manager: DASHBOARD, FRONT, MODQUEUE, RANDNSFW (thanks to Signe for the last 2)
- Added "View Images" tab to Dashboard
- Added the ability to control how long thread subscriptions last (in New Comments Count module)
- Added "refresh all" function to dashboard
- Added the ability to show current username in account switcher (thanks, Lugghawk!)
