changelog v4.1.0

- New features

	- Major overhaul to how and when certain parts of RES are executed - this MAY result in getting rid of the dreaded "flash of unstyled content", such as a white page before night mode kicks in, in some cases!
	- Major additions to Dashboard - you can now see all of your user tags and subscribed threads there!
	- Some efficiency improvements specific to the Firefox addon including: compiling with a new addon SDK version (biggest help), some adjustments to how storage is handled between tabs, and eliminating some code

	- User tagger now stores a link to the link or comment you tagged a user from by default
	- Added easy-access NSFW filter toggle to dropdown menu

	- Updated account switcher dropdown for easier access and more UI consistency
	- Completely overhauled how uppers/downers are displayed - no more JSON request required, which means it's faster!

	- Adjusted clickable area for selecting comments
	- Added new subreddit tooltip - allows easy filtering, adding of shortcuts/dashboard widgets, etc

	- Better support for Chrome and Safari's ability to let you divert comment links to new tabs (or choose not to)
	- "Load new comments links" now work with the keyboard!
- Uppers and Downers
	- Now they load on "load new comments" comments!
		- Note: This only works on "nested" comments, not the links at the bottom of the page. Long story.
- Inline Image Viewer
	- Removed the "useSmallImage" option and replaced it with "imageSize" - pick any size image from imgur! Great for low bandwidth connections, and smaller screens like netbooks.
- Live Comment Preview
	- Surprise! Live preview of tables!

	- Fixed a settings issue that was causing problems in Chrome dev builds. More a bug with Chrome in my opinion, but whatever. ;-)
- User Tagger
	- Fixed that nagging issue where a tooltip stays up if you move the mouse out while it's fading in -- BUT:
		- I cannot for the life of me figure out a good way to stop this from happening when you scroll your mousewheel but do not move the mouse. Sorry.

	- Fixed a conflict between inline image viewer and keyboard navigation in comment links
- Show Parent
	- Fixed a cosmetic issue for users with Comment Boxes turned off

	- Made some updates to RedditDark for users with Comment Boxes turned off
- Save Comments
	- Fixed a bug where "what's hot" in subreddits didn't work correctly
