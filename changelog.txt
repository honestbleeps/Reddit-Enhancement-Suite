changelog v4.1.0

- New features

	- Major overhaul to how and when certain parts of RES are executed - this MAY result in getting rid of the dreaded "flash of unstyled content", such as a white page before night mode kicks in, in some cases!
	- Major additions to Dashboard - you can now see all of your user tags and subscribed threads there!
	- Some efficiency improvements specific to the Firefox addon including: compiling with a new addon SDK version (biggest help), some adjustments to how storage is handled between tabs, and eliminating some code
	- Added "fadespeed" option to user hover tooltip so that users can have it fade in/out faster (or just instantly appear)
	- User tagger now stores a link to the link or comment you tagged a user from by default
	- Added easy-access NSFW filter toggle to dropdown menu
	- Now calling more HTTPS stuff to play nicer with addons like HTTPS Everywhere (note: compatibility is still not guaranteed)
	- Added a way to dynamically grab known/popular bug reports and feature requests for when people try to submit to Enhancement or RESIssues
	- Updated account switcher dropdown for easier access and more UI consistency
	- Completely overhauled how uppers/downers are displayed - no more JSON request required, which means it's faster!
	- Added "turbo selftext" option - which will make selftext expandos much faster after the first one you load on any given page
	- Adjusted clickable area for selecting comments
	- Added new subreddit tooltip - allows easy filtering, adding of shortcuts/dashboard widgets, etc
	- New module: Comment hide persistor - keeps track of collapsed comments and re-collapses them when you return to a thread - thanks, umbrae!
	- Added the ability to add custom macro buttons to comment preview toolbar
	- Added "source" button to inbox
	- Adding a class of .res to the BODY tag to help moderators better style their subreddits with RES in mind
	- Added app=res to all calls to Reddit, so that the Reddit admins can more easily measure RES's impact
	- Major overhaul of inline image viewer - improved code, support for a few more sites (deviantart, imgclean, picsarus, i.qkme), etc.
	- Added a checkbox to more easily disable RES tips and tricks
	- User tagger hover tip now works on /u/username links

	- No longer auto-linking subreddits since Reddit now does it itself
	- "Hard ignore" option in User Tagger now collapses sub comments as well
	- Disabling "spam button" module by default due to misuse/abuse. If enabled, button now reads "rts" so as not to conflict with newly added "spam" button from Reddit itself
	- Made a few code changes that should allow older versions of Firefox (via Greasemonkey) to still work. I cannot actively support this with a lot of time, but a cursory test shows you should be able to run RES with FF3.6+GM now.
	- Added code to allow saving of comments even if they're from deleted users.
	- Added user tagger / hover tip to flair page for moderators
	- Added the ability for filteReddit and dashboard subreddits to be added even if they don't exist in Reddit's autocomplete feature
	- Improved multireddit experience - now including +dashboard and +shortcut buttons for each reddit in the sidebar, etc
	- Added "reddiquette" button to comment preview toolbar
	- Updates to Reddit API calls to maintain current location protocol (should mean less problems browsing https with pay.reddit.com)
	- Added a few more optional links to the subreddit manager: DASHBOARD, FRONT, MODQUEUE, RANDNSFW (thanks to Signe for the last 2)
	- Added "View Images" tab to Dashboard
	- Added the ability to control how long thread subscriptions last (in New Comments Count module)
	- Added "refresh all" function to dashboard
	- Added the ability to show current username in account switcher (thanks, Lugghawk!)

	- Adjusted how Firefox handles tab communication of settings changes - should be much more efficient
	- Never Ending Reddit no longer relies on rewriting the current URL to keep track of what page you're on, which should alleviate ctrl-f borking out in Chrome, and also a caching/history problem in Chrome

	- Some fixes for user hover tooltip placement / alignment
