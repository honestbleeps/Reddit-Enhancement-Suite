# Localization

**Do not edit the files in this directory, they are automatically generated.**

[Instead, visit Transifex if you wish to submit translations.](https://www.transifex.com/reddit-enhancement-suite/reddit-enhancement-suite/)

## New strings

New strings should be added to `en.json` and only that file.

## Translating Modules

Currently only module names/categories and descriptions are translatable. Please see [this](https://github.com/honestbleeps/Reddit-Enhancement-Suite/blob/master/lib/modules/commentHidePersistor.js) module for an example of how its implemented.

These strings can be found in en.json which then show the English string. List of categories can also be found near the top of en.json. 

Modules will be reviweed for i18n before merge.
