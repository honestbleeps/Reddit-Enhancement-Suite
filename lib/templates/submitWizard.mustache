                Enjoy April Fool's. RES can't turn off any of reddit's shenanigans. However, <a href="/r/Enhancement/wiki/faq/srstyle" target="_blank">you can turn off subreddit styles</a>.

        Do you need help with RES or want to report a bug?
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Try <a href="/r/RESissues/wiki/postanissue">troubleshooting it yourself</a>.</li>
            <li>Have you <a target="_blank" href="/r/RESissues/search?restrict_sr=on">searched /r/RESIssues</a> to see if someone else has reported it?</li>
            <li>Check the <a target="_blank" href="/r/Enhancement/wiki/faq">RES FAQ</a> </li>
            <li>
                This might already be a known issue:
                <ul id="RESKnownBugs"><li style="color: red;">Loading...</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

    </div>
    <div id="RESFeatureRequest">
        So you want to request a feature. Great! Please just consider the following first:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>Have you <a target="_blank" href="/r/Enhancement/search?restrict_sr=on">searched /r/Enhancement</a> to see if someone else has requested it?</li>
            <li>Would your idea appeal to many redditors? Personal or subreddit-specific requests usually aren't added to RES.</li>
            <li>See if someone else has already requested this:
                <ul id="RESKnownFeatureRequests"><li style="color: red;">Loading...</li></ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <span id="submittingFeature" class="submittingToEnhancementButton">I still want to submit a feature request!</span>
    </div>
