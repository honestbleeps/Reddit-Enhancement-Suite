This project imports several third-party ("vendor") libraries which are unavailable via yarn. These files are stored in this directory, along with several ancillary files.

# SCSS vs CSS

Vendor libraries typically ship `.css` files. They are stored here as `.scss` files for compatibility with this project's build system.
