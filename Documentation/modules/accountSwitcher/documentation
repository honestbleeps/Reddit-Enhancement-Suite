<b>RES Version</b>
<p>Added in RES v1.75</p>
<p>Bugfixes and feature enhancements added in RES Versions 1.8, 2.1, 2.6, and 2.7</p>
<b>Feature Description</b>
<p>The Account Switcher Module allows you to switch between your accounts on Reddit.  This can be done without having to logout or enter the username and password yourself.</p>
<p>The information for these accounts is only stored in RES Preferences.</p>
<b>Configuration Options</b>
<p>To add an account, navigate to the RES Settings and select "+add account" under the Accounts > Account Switcher submenu.  Two blank fields will then appear, one for the username and one for the password.  Simply enter the info in these boxes and click "Save Options" in the upper right corner.  To add more accounts, click "+add account" and repeat the process</p>
<p>The "keepLoggedIn" option allows RES to keep you logged in on your account when you restart your browser.  This is a substitute for the "Remember Me" button that appears when you log in to Reddit.</p>
<p>To completely disable this module, make sure the "On/Off" switch is in the "Off" position and highlighted red</p>
<b>Usage</b>
<p>After you have setup the accounts you wish to switch between you will then see a small drop-down arrow next to your username in the header, clicking this will show you which accounts you can switch to. From there click on the account you want to switch to and you'll be switched.</p>
